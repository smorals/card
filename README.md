## Documentation

This is my portfolio site! The purpose of this site is to display my work,  show my offerings, and connect me with potential clients or fellow artists. I built this business card site to easily link to places where my work and experience are displayed, as well as where people can get in touch with me. 
While this is not my first time designing a website, this is my first time creating one through code. Building this site taught me the basics of using HTML and CSS. 

Multiple processes were employed in the building of this site. Based on previously-documented ideas, I developed my personal branding. The final elements were created in Adobe Illustrator, presented in mockup format using Figma, and coded using VS Code. To ensure the site meets accessibility standards, I included alt text, and ensured the colors and fonts were readable & visible to all viewers.
